# Laurent for Home Assistant

[In Russian](README_ru.md)

This integration provides support for some of [KernelChip] devices.

## Usage

Install it as [Custom repository] within HACS and activate it from UI. You've to provide unique name for your device,
host and password (passwordless access is not supported).

## Roadmap

I've made this integration for my only KernelChip's device ([Laurent-112]). According to documentation, this integration
may also support [Laurent-128] but I haven't tested it. I don't have any plans supporting other devices.

You may send PR to provide support for other devices, or just fork it.
